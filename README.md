Once Mouf is installed, you can process to the Fine installation.

Install Fine
--------------

If you want an easy installation, please add the package utils.i18n.fine.common at the same time in your configuration.
Edit your *composer.json* file, and add a dependency on *mouf/utils.i18n.fine.file-translation.

A minimal *composer.json* file might look like this:
```
	{
	    "require": {
	        "mouf/mouf": "~2.0",
	        "mouf/utils.i18n.fine.file-translator": "4.0.*"
	    },
	    "autoload": {
	        "psr-0": {
	            "Test": "src/"
	        }
	    },
	    "minimum-stability": "dev"
	}
```
As explained above, Fine is a package of the Mouf framework. Mouf allows you (amoung other things) to visualy "build" your project's dependencies and instances.

To install the dependency, run
	php composer.phar install
